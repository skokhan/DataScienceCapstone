# Predictive Analysis (Classification)

- ### Data Preprocessing and Standardization​
  We start by loading data from a CSV file. To effectively utilize machine learning, we begin by preprocessing and standardizing our data for classification models.​

- ### Train/Test Split​
  Next, we perform a train/test split to evaluate the models. This split allows us to use one portion of the data for training the model and another for analyzing its performance.​

- ### Build and Train Models​
  We employ various machine learning techniques to build predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classifiers, and k-Nearest Neighbors.​

- ### Tune Models​
  Additionally, we implement Grid Search to fine-tune these models and identify the optimal hyperparameters.​

- ### Assess the Performance and Effectiveness​
  Finally, we assess the accuracy of each model and plot confusion matrices to determine which one performs the best, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of our predictive classification analysis.​
