# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization techniques, we use scatter plots, bar plot, and line plot to examine the data. This helps us identify which attributes correlate with successful landings, extract meaningful patterns and trends, and conduct feature engineering.

### Scatter Plots​
- FlightNumber vs. PayloadMass;​
- FlightNumber vs. LaunchSite;​
- Payload Mass vs. Launch Site;​
- FlightNumber and Orbit type;​
- Payload Mass vs. Orbit type.​

A scatter plot uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. We use scatter plots to identify relationships between different attributes and successful landings.​​

### Bar Plot​

- Success Rate vs. Orbit Type.​

A bar graph shows a comparison among categories. We use a bar plot to identify which orbits have the highest success rates.​

### Line Plot​

- The Launch Success Yearly Trend.​

Line plots are helpful for tracking changes over time. We use a line plot to visualize the average launch success trend.​
