# Data Science Capstone

<p>In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.</p>

# Learning Objectives
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame;
- Convert a JSON file into a Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file;
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub;
- Utilize data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem;
- Utilize your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.

# Project Scenario and Overview
<p>The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. 
SpaceX’s accomplishments include: </p>
- Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station;
- Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access;
- Sending manned missions to Space. 
<p>One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces X’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets.</p>
<p>In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, Space Y, that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Elon Musk. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for your team. You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.</p>
