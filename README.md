# Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM

<p>This is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. This capstone project course will give you the chance to practice the work that Data Scientists do in real life when working with datasets.</p>

<p>In this capstone you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.</p>

<p>You will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.</p>

# Learning Objectives
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas data frame;
- Create a Python Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file;
- Create a Jupyter notebook and make it sharable using GitHub;
- Utilize data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem;
- Utilize your data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.

# Project Scenario and Overview
<p>The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. 
SpaceX’s accomplishments include:</p>

- Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station;
- Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access;
- Sending manned missions to Space.

<p>SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets.</p>

<p>In this capstone, you will take the role of a Data Scientist working for a new rocket company, SpaceY, that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Elon Musk. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will do this by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards for your team. You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.</p>
