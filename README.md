# Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM

<p>This course is the final component of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. The capstone project offers you the opportunity to practice real-life data science work with actual datasets.</p>

<p>In this capstone, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. You will follow the data science methodology, which includes data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.</p>

<p>Your primary task will be to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. By leveraging your data science findings and models, the startup you are working for can make more informed bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.</p>

# Learning Objectives
- Develop Python code to manipulate data within a Pandas DataFrame;
- Create a Pandas DataFrame by converting data from a JSON file;
- Set up a Jupyter Notebook and make it shareable using GitHub;
- Apply data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem;
- Use data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and uncover valuable insights;
- Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) by manipulating data in a Pandas DataFrame;
- Create and execute SQL queries to analyze data;
- Generate scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas DataFrame;
- Utilize data visualization tools to extract meaningful patterns that guide the modeling process and perform feature engineering;
- Build an interactive dashboard to analyze launch records using Plotly Dash;
- Create pie charts and scatter plots with the Plotly Dash library to visualize data;
- Develop interactive maps to analyze the proximity of launch sites using Folium;
- Utilize interactive maps, plot coordinates, and marker clusters by writing Python code with the Folium library;
- Calculate distances on an interactive map by implementing Python code using the Folium library;
- Preprocess and standardize data for machine learning classification models;
- Perform a train/test split for model evaluation;
- Use machine learning techniques to build predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and k-Nearest Neighbors;
- Utilize Grid Search to tune models and identify the best hyperparameters;
- Evaluate model accuracy to determine which model performs best, thereby helping the business function more effectively.

# Project Scenario and Overview
<p>We are in the age of commercial space travel, where companies are making space exploration more accessible to everyone. Virgin Galactic is offering suborbital spaceflights, while Rocket Lab focuses on small satellite launching. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets, but perhaps the most successful of them all is SpaceX.</p>

<p>SpaceX boasts several notable accomplishments:</p>

- Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station;
- Launching Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing global satellite Internet access;
- Conducting manned missions to space.

<p>SpaceX advertises its Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, while competitors charge upwards of $165 million. A significant portion of the savings stems from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets. Therefore, if we can determine whether the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the launch cost. This information would be valuable for any competing company wanting to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.</p>

<p>In this capstone, you will take on the role of a Data Scientist for a new rocket company, SpaceY, that aims to compete with SpaceX, founded by billionaire industrialist Elon Musk. Your job will involve gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards for your team. Additionally, you will analyze if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of relying on traditional rocket science, you will train a machine learning model using public information to predict the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully.</p>
